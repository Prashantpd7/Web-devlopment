# 🌐 My Web Development Journey  

Welcome to my web development journey! ✨  
This repository will be my learning space where I’ll push all my code and projects as I grow step by step in web development.  

## 📖 About This Repo
- Starting from **basic HTML** 📝  
- Moving into **CSS for styling** 🎨  
- Adding **JavaScript for interactivity** ⚡  
- Exploring **modern frameworks & projects** 🚀  

## 🎯 Goal
To build a strong foundation in **frontend development** and eventually move toward **full-stack development**.  

## 📂 What You’ll Find Here
- `First.html` → My very first HTML page (Hello World 👋)  
- More practice files as I learn new concepts  
- Small projects & experiments to practice what I learn  

## 🌱 Why This Repo?
I want to **track my progress publicly** and keep everything organized in one place.  
It will also show how I grow from writing my first HTML file to building real-world projects.  

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Learn and practice **HTML basics**  
- Style pages with **CSS**  
- Add logic with **JavaScript**  
- Work on **mini-projects** and share them here
